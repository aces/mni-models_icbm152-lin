		     ICBM Average Brain (ICBM152)
		    Stereotaxic Registration Model

This is a version of the ICBM Average Brain - an average of 152
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly transformed to Talairach space - that
is specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear Registration Package
(mni_autoreg).

Please note that this volume here is different from the mni305 model
(average_305) that was originally (back in ancient times) included
with mni_autoreg.

 Included in this package are the following files:

     Makefile
	makefile to do everything for you (see instructions below)
     icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc 
	a version of the average MRI that covers the whole brain
        (unlike the original Talairach atlas), sampled with 1mm cubic
        voxels
     icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc 
	a mask of the average brain in icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc,
	semi-automatically created by Dr. Louis Collins.  Note that
	this mask has had holes filled in, so it is a connected volume
	but includes non-brain tissue (eg. the CSF in the ventricles)
     icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc 
	another mask, required for nonlinear mode


Here's a brief summary of what you need to do:

1) Build and install the entire MNI AutoReg package, as described in
   the README with that package.  (Note that this may entail building
   netCDF, MINC, and Perl 5 in addition to the programs included with
   the MNI AutoReg package.)  You *can* perform the "make check" step
   before building and installing the stereotaxic model, but you won't
   be able to do any real registrations with mritotal until the model
   is installed.
2) Install the model:
     * edit Makefile; make sure that prefix used here is the same as the
       prefix used to install MNI AutoReg
     * type "make install"

Now, you're ready to try out mritotal on real data.  See the file
TESTING included with MNI AutoReg for instructions on doing this.
