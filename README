		     ICBM Average Brain (ICBM152)
		    Stereotaxic Registration Model

This is a version of the ICBM Average Brain - an average of 152
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly transformed to Talairach space - that
is specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear Registration Package
(mni_autoreg).

Please note that this volume here is different from the mni305 model
(average_305) that was originally (back in ancient times) included
with mni_autoreg.

 Included in this package are the following files:

     icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc 
	a version of the average MRI that covers the whole brain
        (unlike the original Talairach atlas), sampled with 1mm cubic
        voxels
     icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc 
	a mask of the average brain in icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc,
	semi-automatically created by Dr. Louis Collins.  Note that
	this mask has had holes filled in, so it is a connected volume
	but includes non-brain tissue (eg. the CSF in the ventricles)
     icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.mnc 
	another mask, required for nonlinear mode
